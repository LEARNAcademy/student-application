"When an instructor reviews a student's assessment the instructor is evaluating the work through the lens of the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. The Dreyfus model describes how individuals progress through various levels in their learning process of new skills in the following levels: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, expert. For this course students will be evaluated as novice, advanced beginner, or competent skill levels. Skill levels are not grades! Skill levels measure current understanding of a set of topics covered in class.",
