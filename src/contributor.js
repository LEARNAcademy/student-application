It's crazy to think about how everything we use these days, from our phones to our microwaves, is powered by software in some form, and I just can't get enough of it. Fun fact about me - I used to be a Hospital Corpsman in the USN and am currently an active Martial Arts instructor. Those experiences have taught me a lot about being patient with myself and others when working on objectives and having a keen attention to detail. I think those same skills and attitudes serve me well in the coding environment.ü•ã When I'm not buried in code or working on a new project, you can find me doing some of my favorite things. I love listening to music üéß, watching anime üçø, and participating in Martial Arts. I've been practicing Martial Arts since I was seven and have spent the last nine years competing and coaching.
